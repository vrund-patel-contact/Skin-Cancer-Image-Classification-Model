# Skin-Cancer-Image-Classification-Model

utilized and modified a EfficientNetB5 Convolutional Neural Network that can accurately identify whether an image is deemed malignant or benign at an accuracy of 91.20%. The accuracy of 91.20% is achieved after 15 epochs. If the number of epochs are modified (ex. from 15 epochs to 40 or 50 epochs), the accuracy of the final model can be much greater than 91.20 percent.
